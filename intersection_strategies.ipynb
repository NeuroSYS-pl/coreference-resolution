    "We use two models: **AllenNLP** and **Huggingface**. In multiple tests AllenNLP turned out much better - it has better precision and recall (on [Google GAP dataset](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/gap-coreference)), and finds much more clusters at all. That's why we decide to take <ins>AllenNLP answers as a ground truth</ins>.   \n",
    "However AllenNLP also makes mistakes - it has about 8% of false positives which we would like to minimize. That's why we propose **several intersections of AllenNLP and Huggingface outputs (an ensemble)** to modify the results and gain more confidence about the final clusters.  \n",

    "- **strict** - we take only those clusters that are identical both in AllenNLP and Huggingface (intersection of clusters)\n",
    "- **partial** - we take all of the spans that are identical both in AllenNLP and Huggingface (intersection of spans/mentions)\n",
    "- **fuzzy** - we take all of the spans that are the same but also we find spans that overlap (are relating to the same entity but are composed of different number of tokens) and choose the shorter one"
